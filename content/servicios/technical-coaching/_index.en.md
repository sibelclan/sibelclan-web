At Sibelclan we know that the main objective of software is to generate value for the business, but we also understand the demotivation of constantly struggling to continue implementing features, while keeping all fires under control and trying to improve the code little by little, even with the constant pressure of the business and the impotence of not reaching an understanding.

For this reason, we put all our experience applying the principles and practices of agile development methodologies such as XP (Extreme Programming) and DevOps at the disposal of your team, with whom we will work side by side from the day to day of your project. We will foster the adoption of good practices, habits and the creation of a sustainable pace, to guarantee the performance and predictability of the team in the long term.

We will help the team to collaborate with business stakeholders and end users, optimize their development processes, shape their technical vision and build quality software incrementally. We will do it in Pair and Mob Programming sessions, as well as facilitating team dynamics. We will transfer any knowledge that the team may lack (eg TDD, refactoring, DDD, CI/CD, etc.), at the right time and from an applied point of view, through Learning Hours.

We will foster and cultivate a culture of continuous improvement and learning among all team members so that, when we leave, the team can continue to grow without us and constantly add value to users and stakeholders, without relevant incidents, without eternal stoppages to refactor, with almost instantaneous and risk-free deployments and, above all, with people who are happy and proud to belong to your team.
